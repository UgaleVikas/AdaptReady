# Adapt Ready QA Challenge â€“ Patent Date Comparison
This project is a Python Selenium automation script that:
- Searches for a patent (e.g., rop) on https://patinformed.wipo.int/.
- Extracts key patent dates (Filing, Publication, Grant).
- Calculates and prints the difference between these dates in days.
